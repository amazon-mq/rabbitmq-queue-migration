# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Build

To build this plugin in your RabbitMQ development environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git
cd rabbitmq-server
git clone https://github.com/amazon-mq/rabbitmq-queue-migration.git deps/rabbitmq_queue_migration
make -C deps/aws
```

To run RabbitMQ with this plugin:

```
cd path/to/rabbitmq-server
make PLUGINS='rabbitmq_management rabbitmq_shovel rabbitmq_shovel_management rabbitmq_queue_migration' run-broker
```

### Code Formatting

This project uses [`erlfmt`](https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt) for consistent Erlang code formatting. All code must pass
`erlfmt -c` checks before merging. PRs that fail `erlfmt` checks will not be merged.

To build `erlfmt`:

```
git clone https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt.git erlfmt
cd erlfmt && rebar3 as release escriptize
```

To format your code before submitting:

```bash
path/to/erlfmt/_build/release/bin/erlfmt -w
```

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open a [**discussion**](https://github.com/amazon-mq/rabbitmq-queue-migration/discussions) to discuss any significant work - we
   would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository, and create a branch on which to apply your changes.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be
   hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the
default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted'
issues is a great place to start.
